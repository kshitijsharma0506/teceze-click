# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


# Installation
Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd your-project
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```
Running the Development Server
To start the local development server with Hot Module Replacement (HMR), run the following command:

```bash

npm run dev
```

This will launch the app at http://localhost:5173. The server will automatically reload if any changes are made to the source files.

Building for Production
To create an optimized production build, run:

``` bash
npm run build
```
This will generate the compiled output in the dist/ folder, optimized for speed and efficiency.

Preview Production Build
To preview the build locally after running npm run build, you can use the following command:

bash

npm run preview
